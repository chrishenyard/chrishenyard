# 👋 Hi, I'm **Christopher Henyard**
### **Principal Software Engineer | Architect | Problem Solver**

Principal Software Engineer specializing in ASP.NET Core 8–10, EF Core 8-10, SQL Server performance, Stripe integrations, Apple/Google Wallet, multi-tenant architecture, JavaScript, and large-scale data pipelines. Delivers clean, production-ready solutions with minimal supervision. Strong track record of building modern platforms, streamlining complex workflows, integrating payment systems, and processing massive datasets with high performance and accuracy. Recently expanded into AI application development, designing local-first LLM solutions, vector search pipelines, and developer productivity tooling.

---

## 🚀 **My Current Goals**

- Design local-first LLM solutions, vector search pipelines, and developer productivity tooling
- Build **enterprise-grade .NET platforms** that emphasize simplicity and long-term reliability  
- Deepen expertise in **low-level Linux, networking, and virtualization** (pfSense/OPNsense, Proxmox)  
- Continue modernizing ecosystems from **legacy .NET → ASP.NET Core**  
- Master **fully automated deployment ecosystems** using Docker & CI/CD  
- Expand into **developer tooling** for Stripe, gRPC, and Wallet integrations  
- Contribute more **open-source utilities** around performance, data ingestion, and multi-tenant architectures

## 🏆 **Highlighted Achievements**

### **✔ Vector Search**
 Semantic Code & Document Query Platform. Local-first AI system using embeddings, vector storage, and natural-language querying.

### **✔ Built multi-tenant architectures**
Designed tenant-aware routing, scoped DbContexts, and middleware-based tenant resolution — enabling clean separation of customer data and behavior.  

### **✔ Implemented full Stripe billing ecosystems**
PaymentIntents, Subscriptions, webhooks, retries, SetupIntents, 3DS, and async pipelines using Channels + Hosted Services.  

### **✔ Integrated Apple Wallet & Google Wallet**
Delivered secure, dynamically updating passes for loyalty, membership, and credential systems.  

### **✔ Built high-speed ingestion pipelines**
Capable of processing **7–15GB CSV files** using chunked streaming and dynamic schema execution.  

### **✔ Modernized legacy .NET ecosystems**
Converted aging .NET Framework systems into high-performance ASP.NET Core platforms with dramatic reliability/performance improvements.  

### **✔ Delivered large admin systems with minimal JavaScript**
DataTables + Bootstrap 5 + AJAX CRUD → highly maintainable, fast-to-extend admin dashboards.
