# 👋 Hi, I'm **Christopher Henyard**
### **Principal Software Engineer | Architect | Problem Solver**

Principal Software Engineer specializing in ASP.NET Core 8–10, EF Core 8-10, SQL Server performance, Stripe integrations, Apple/Google Wallet, multi-tenant architecture, JavaScript, and large-scale data pipelines. Delivers clean, production-ready solutions with minimal supervision. Strong track record of building modern platforms, streamlining complex workflows, integrating payment systems, and processing massive datasets with high performance and accuracy. Recently expanded into AI application development, designing local-first LLM solutions, vector search pipelines, and developer productivity tooling.

## 🚀 **My Current Goals**

- Build **enterprise-grade .NET platforms** that emphasize simplicity and long-term reliability  
- Deepen expertise in **low-level Linux, networking, and virtualization** (pfSense/OPNsense, Proxmox)  
- Continue modernizing ecosystems from **legacy .NET → ASP.NET Core**  
- Master **fully automated deployment ecosystems** using Docker & CI/CD  
- Expand into **developer tooling** for Stripe, gRPC, and Wallet integrations  
- Contribute more **open-source utilities** around performance, data ingestion, and multi-tenant architectures

## 🧰 **Tech Stack & Tools I Use Daily**

### **Backend & Architecture**
- **ASP.NET Core 7–9**, C#, EF Core 8/9  
- REST APIs, **gRPC**, Webhooks  
- Multi-Tenant Systems, Middleware, Interceptors  
- Channels, Background Services (Hosted Services)

### **Payments & Integrations**
- **Stripe** (PaymentIntents, Subscriptions, 3DS, SetupIntents, Off-Session Billing, Application Fees)  
- **Apple Wallet (PassKit)**  
- **Google Wallet Objects API**  
- OAuth 2.0, HMAC auth patterns

### **Data Engineering**
- SQL Server 2012–2022  
- Performance tuning, indexing, MERGE optimization  
- Large-scale ingestion (7GB–15GB+ CSV pipelines)  
- ETL pipelines, BCP automation, streaming architectures

### **Cloud, DevOps & Infrastructure**
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Linux server administration  
- Proxmox virtualization  
- Secure environment configuration & containerized ecosystems

### **Frontend (Minimal but Effective)**
- JavaScript, Bootstrap 5  
- jQuery DataTables (dynamic modals + AJAX CRUD)  
- Lightweight and maintainable UI patterns
